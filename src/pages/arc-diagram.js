          <p>
            As far as I know, there isn't any proper way to build an arc diagram with python üòû. If you're aware of any tip to build it, please let me knwo! My contact is provided below üôèüèΩ.
        </p>
          <p>You now have 3 options!</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use an alternative chart type. See the <code>related chart</code> section below.</li>
            <li>Use <code>R</code> or <code>D3.js</code> instead of <code>python</code>, links are provided below as well.</li>
            <li>Build a Python library allowing to build them! I would love to share it here! üòä</li>

        <h2 id="Other languages">Arc diagram with <code>R</code> or <code>Javascript</code></h2>
        <p>
          Contrary to <code>python</code> that is not of much help to build an arc diagram, <code>R</code> and <code>Javascript</code> both offer built-in functions
          to make them. <code>R</code> will be more adapted if you're a data analyst and are happy with a static version. <code>Javascript</code> and the
          <code>d3.js</code> library offers more customization and interactivity options, but comes with a steeper learning curve and a lot
          of line of code. Pick your flavor!

        <p>Here is an arc diagram showing the relationships between researchers. One <u>node</u> is drawn for each researcher having published at least one paper with my previous supervisor, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ranwez/">Vincent Ranwez</a>. Two researchers are <u>linked</u> if they co-authored at least one paper together. Read more about this dataset <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/story/AdjacencyMatrix.html">here</a>.</p>
